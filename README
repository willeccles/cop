                           cop - cactus option picker

cop is a small TUI program built around a library of the same name whose main
goal is to allow you to easily display a list of options the user can
interactively pick from.

## TUI

The TUI program is quite simple - you can supply an optional title and a list of
options for the user to pick from. The program will print out the option the
user picked after it is finished running. If its exit status is non-zero, the
user did not pick and option or there was an error of some kind. In this case,
it will not print anything.

## Library

The cop library requires the user to manage the terminal. You will supply a list
of entries which cop will display with the given parameters. For information,
see include/libcop.h. You can also see the TUI's source (in the src directory)
for a reference program, as it should be seen as the 'gold standard' of
a program using libcop.

Note that the library is a static library as opposed to shared, since it is
unlikely this will be packaged for distribution. If this is an issue, feel free
to open a PR with a shared library added to the Makefile. It should be pretty
trivial.

## Building

You can build both the library and the TUI by running `make' with no arguments.
If you wish to build just the TUI or the library, you can do either `make tui'
or `make lib'. The output will be in either build/tui or build/lib. Note that
the TUI will always force the library to be built, since it requires it to
function.
